### Strategy Pattern

* Behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a chain of business logic you want execute

### How can we achieve

* Create an interface. Add abstract method
* Implement the interface in the subclass
* Get the list of responsibilities and call the method to execute the responsibility

### Examples

* Sending notification to a chain of channels 
* Validating a chain of business rules and collect those validation errors
